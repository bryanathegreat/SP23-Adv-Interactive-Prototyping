# SP23-Adv-Interactive-Prototyping   

## Introduction

My project is a crochet stand that helps people crochet in a more convenient way without having to struggle with the knots in the yarn. Based on my initial ideation, I was only going to use the servo motor to spin around the yarn to unwind, but as I was going through the process of user paint points in crocheting, I thought that it would make sense to have the user wind their yarn on first, then have a motion sensor on their wrist to automatically unwind the yarn for them.

## Implementation

### Hardware

1. light sensor (input)
2. angle unit (input)
3. LED strip light (output)
4. servo motor (output)
5. imu sensor (input)
6. two atom matrix boards

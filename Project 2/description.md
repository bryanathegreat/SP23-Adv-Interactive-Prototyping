# Project 2 Description   
The initial idea behind this project was to use analog sensors in a book stand that turns off the lights automatically when the reader is too close to the book. I first tried using the light sensor so that it can sense the book put on the stand, which would turn on the light. Then the TOF sensor would sense proximity of the reader and turn off the light once they are too close. But, my initial idea had some technical difficulties, so I had to change my physical execution and changed it by having a button to turn on the lights, then the light sensor would sense the reader's proximity and have the same function.
